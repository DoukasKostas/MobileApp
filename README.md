# SmartTaPanda - Mobile App

This app was developed as part of my bachelor thesis.

It start by asking for authentication and then it gives you access to the main screen, where you can watch and switch the state of 4 relays.

The purpose of the system is to control home appliances over the Internet with the use of an Android mobile phone or tablet.
